#### **2.) Lucky Bay, Esperance, south coast of western Australia**

Located in the Cape Le Grand National Park the bay is known for its bright white sands and turquoise coloured waters.

While exploring the south coast of Australia in 1802, Matthew Flinders sailed a dangerous route through the Recherche Archipelago. He named Lucky Bay when his vessel HMS Investigator took shelter there from a summer storm.

The sheltered bay is ideal for swimming, snorkelling, fishing and surfing.

You may be lucky enough to meet one of the friendly kangaroos chilling on the beach :)
